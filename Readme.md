# Roadmap.sh Projects
[Click on the link](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game)

This repository contains my implementations of projects from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)   

The goal of this repo is to practice and showcase solutions for different **frontend** and **backend** projects as suggested in the roadmap.sh guides.  
Each project is organized into folders for clarity and ease of navigation.

## Structure
- **/Frontend** → Projects related to frontend development  
- **/Backend** → Projects related to backend development  

## About Roadmap.sh
[roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) is a community-driven learning platform that provides developer roadmaps, guides, and project ideas to help you learn and grow as a developer.  
This repo follows those project ideas to build a solid foundation through hands-on coding practice.
