### Goal
The goal of this project is to build a simple **number guessing game** where the program randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.  
This project helps in practicing **logic building, loops, conditionals, and user input handling**, making it a great starting point for beginners.

### Requirements
- [x] The program should randomly generate a number within a given range (e.g., 1â€“100).
- [x] The user should be able to input guesses.
- [x] The program should provide hints if the guess is **too high** or **too low**.
- [x] Limit the number of attempts a user can make.
- [x] Display a success message if the user guesses correctly.
- [x] End the game with a failure message if attempts run out.
